# hello-world
Just another repository

Well hello everyone. You can call me Josh, but I'd prefer you call me a friend.
I enjoy writing. I take personal and professional development seriously. I'm interested SEO & oganic traffic strategy. I have been involved in digital marketing for many years, going back to when I founded a hobby site. I kept the website relevant and grew the traffic via organic traffic sources.
